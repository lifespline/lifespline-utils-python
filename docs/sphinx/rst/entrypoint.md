# Getting Started

To contribute to the package you need to download the src locally. Once you've done so, [`bootstrap`](sphinx/rst/bootstrap.md) your local environment so you have all system and app dependencies installed. Having done so, you are ready to develop your own package version. You'll find documentation below to aid you on your development operations.
