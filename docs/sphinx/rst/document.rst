About
-----

The documentation shows how to document your module.

Getting Started
---------------

The project uses `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to automatically generate documentation from the project's source files. You will find the service configuration ``docs/sphinx/conf.py`` that specifies things like the theme or the paths where the source files are to be found. The original documentation is in ``docs/sphinx/rst``, which is then parsed into HTML to ``docs/rst`` and committed as-is.
