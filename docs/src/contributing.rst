About
-----

The documentation shows how to contribute to the project.

Getting Started
---------------

To contribute to the package you need to download the src locally. Once you've done so, :doc:`bootstrap <bootstrap>` your local environment so you have all system and app dependencies installed. Having done so, you are ready to develop your own package version. Read through the contents for documentation to aid you on your development operations.
